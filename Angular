1. You are creating an Angular application where you must manually set the runtime locale. What would you add to the following code so the runtime value is ar-SA?
import { LOCALE_ID, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { ImageComp } from '../src/app/image.component';


@NgModule({
  imports: [ BrowserModule ],
  declarations: [ ImageComp ],
  providers: [{provide: LOCALE_ID}],
  ...
})

export class AnalyzePictorial {... }


useValue: 'ar-SA' in the providers


2. What benefit does server-side rendering provide?

It makes static files searchable and provides better search engine optimization (SEO) results.

3. In the case of a command-line interface, how would you create an initial test file for a component?

ng generate component modular --inline-template --inline-style --module app

4. Why might you use a template reference variable?

To provide a reference to a DOM element, directive, or component

5. Which directive would you use to iterate over each form control with a form array?

*ngFor

6. How can you prevent users from visiting pages of your applications that they are not authorized to view?

Use a route guard.

7. What does two-way binding do?

Allows components to share data

8. What is a nested component?

A child component whose tag is included in a parent component's template.

9. What is the difference between two-way binding and event binding?

Two-way binding listens for events and updates values between parent and child components, whereas event binding lets you respond to user actions.

10. An Angular application shows a form that a user will fill out. The form contains a user's name, address, bio, and contact info. Some users submitted the form without filling in their bios. What might be the problem?

The code is missing Validators.required.

11. You write the following code to update a resource on a server using a PUT HTTP request. When you run the code, the resource does not change on the server. Why?
//data.service.ts
updateData(data: Data): Observable<Data> {
 return this.http.put<Data>(this.datasUrl, data, httpOptions)
 .pipe(catchError(this.handleError('updateData', data)));
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

//data.components.ts
this.dataService.updateData(modifyData);


You did not subscribe to an observable that the put() method returned.


12. What decorator do you use to create a service in Angular?

@Injectable

13. What does two-way binding do?
Allows you to listen for events and update values between parent and child components.

14. A child component must implement two-way binding. What must you add to the child component to use two-way binding?

The @Input and @Output decoratorsc

15. What is true about two-way binding?

Two-way binding allows you to listen for events and update values between components.

16. An Angular application uses the following code snippet:
@Component ({
 selector: 'keyvalue-pipe',
 template: '<span>
  <div *ngFor="let i of items | keyvalue">
   {{i.key}}
  </div>
 </span>'
})

export class CountryNames {
 items: {[key:number]: string} = {1: 'Japan', 2: 'Spain', 3: 'France'};
 ...
}
When you run the code, it shows the number, not the country names. How can you fix this?

Add :{{i.value}} after {{i.key}} in the code.

17. You are creating an Angular application that must show an image. What is the correct way to add the src property of the image to the img element?

Use property binding, []
<img alt=" " [src]=" ">

18. How can you navigate between the views of your Angular application?

Through routing


19. Why would you implement a strictly typed form in your Angular application?

To make the reactive forms fully type-safe

20. What does a pipe do in Angular?

Accepts an input value, transforms it, and returns this transformed value.



21. Your application has an AdminArea component that only logged-in users can access. How can you prevent users who are not logged in from accessing this component?

Use the CanActivate route guard.

22. What does the @Input decorator do in a child component?

Indicates that a property can receive its value from a parent component.

23. What is a component in Angular?

The main building block for Angular applications.

24. You are creating a new component in your Angular application. What is the first thing you must do to use the component decorator?

Import Component from '@angular/core'.

25. Why do you use event binding in your code?

To listen and respond to a user's actions

26. What is the difference between a route guard and a wildcard route?

The route guard prevents unauthorized access to restricted parts of your application, whereas the wildcard route handles invalid URLs.

27. You build an Angular application with a form that a user must fill out before saving data. When a user attempts to save data after completing the form, however, the save button appears to be disabled. Why?


The form is not in a valid state.
